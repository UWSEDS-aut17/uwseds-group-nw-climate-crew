-[ ] Update comp_design.md
-[ ] Add "Overview" section text (dynamic? Don't know if Andrew still wants to do this)
-[ ] Delete redundant/outdated files
-[ ] Reorganize "model" directory, move data files
    to "data", etc. (consult Ori/Jen first so we don't break any code)
    -[ ] Also update any dependent file links (mapping, data processing, etc.)
-[ ] Update project README.md:
    -[ ] Add installation/setup instructions
    -[ ] Add broad description of data processing and analysis
    -[ ] Add use case example
-[ ] Add historical viability data (present-day benchmark for comparison)
-[ ] Update presentation slides to reflect current project structure
-[ ] Review ALL code for documentation/commenting/style.
    Further check any python scripts for PEP8 formatting:
    -[ ] futurefish/models/fishmod_utils.py
    -[ ] futurefish/models/FishMod.R
    -[ ] futurefish/models/FishMod.ipynb
    -[ ] (to be written) script for formatting viability data
    -[ ] futurefish/__init__.py
    -[ ] futurefish/dashboard.py
    -[ ] futurefish/futurefish.py
    -[ ] futurefish/interactions.py
    -[ ] futurefish/plotting.py
    -[ ] futurefish/version.py
    -[ ] notebooks/bokeh_plot_exploration.ipynb
    -[ ] notebooks/plotly_2_exploration.ipynb
    -[ ] notebooks/plotly_map_exploration.ipynb
    -[ ] notebooks/plotly_map_generation.ipynb
    -[ ] notebooks/streamflow_processing.ipynb
    -[ ] scripts/futurefish_dash.py
    -[ ] test/data_processing.py --> should probably move this elsewhere
    -[ ] test/run_test.sh
    -[ ] test/test_futurefish.py
    -[ ] setup.py
-[ ] Convert data formatting code from ipynb format to a runnable script
-[ ] Double check course requirements for final project components
    (and make sure we satisfy them all)
-[ ] Check text (especially in public-facing exposition, like README.md
    and app display text) for typos
