Requirements:
* Future projections of streamflow in the Pacific Northwest (PNW)
* Future projections of streamflow temperature
* Information about thresholds for fish habitat.

* CRCC: Dataset available here http://hydro.washington.edu/CRCC/
* NorWeST Stream Temp dataset provided by the Rocky Mountain Research Station. Available here: https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST.html#downloads
* Fish temperature thresholds: Preferred stream discharges for salmon spawning and rearing in Washington.
