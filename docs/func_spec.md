- General audience, familiar with navigating a webpage
- Does not require specific geology and biology knowledge of the region or the species`


### Elements of the Problem Statement:
- What salmon spawn live where currently?
- How will climate change (temperature & streamflow) impact:
  * Where salmon spawn?
  * When salmon spawn?
  * The species distribution?

### Use Cases:
1. Education: teacher making a lesson plan for field trip

In an educational setting a teacher may use the visualization tools to teach classes or plan field trips. For this application the teacher may show the maps in front of a classroom and add and remove different layers including: species type, spawning time, future climate projections. 

2. Recreation: fisherman planning to buy a house!

A fisherman may use this visualization tool to see where salmon will spawn in the future. They can then optimize a piece of real estate that is near where they're favorite species of salmon spawn. They would use the map with the future salmon projection layers and zoom in and out of different regions.  

3. Environment: NGO determining vulnerability of salmon population

From an environmental perspective, this tool could be used to determine what species of salmon are most vulnerable by using the future salmon projection data. They can also see what regions are most vulnerable by looking at the map.
