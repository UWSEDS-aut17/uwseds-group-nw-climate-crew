# Component Design 

1. Reading data:
This is necessary in order to access the information.

2. Processing data:
This is necessary to get our data in the right format.

3. Determining future projections:
This will run a simple model to link the data uploaded and processed in steps 1 and 2. It is necessary for use cases 2 and 3 in our functional specifications.

4. Mapping/visualizing data:
This will allow us to share the results in an interactive format. This is necessary for all use cases.
