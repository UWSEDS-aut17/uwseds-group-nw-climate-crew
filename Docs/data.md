Requirements:
* Future projections of streamflow in the Pacific Northwest
* Temperature projections for the Pacific Northwest
* Information about thresholds for fish habitat.

Sources:
* CRCC: Dataset available here http://hydro.washington.edu/CRCC/
* Future temperature fields at 1/16th degree: Available on cluster that Oriana/Andrew use. Will decide to either extract daily timeseries of temperature at streamflow point locations or use maps.
* Fish temperature thresholds: ???? @jennifer
* USGS stream temperature and air temperature

Evaluation:

| Requirement | CRCC streamflow dataset | Future temperature fields | Fish temperature thresholds | USGS Measurements |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Future projections of streamflow | Daily time series at 400 locations through end of 21st century| x | x |
| Future temperature projections | x | Daily temperature information through end of 21st century  | x |
| Stream temperature model | x | x | Measurements of stream and air temperature at USGS gauged sites |
