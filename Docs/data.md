Requirements:
* Future projections of streamflow in the Pacific Northwest (PNW)
* Future projections of streamflow temperature
* Information about thresholds for fish habitat.

Sources:
* CRCC: Dataset available here http://hydro.washington.edu/CRCC/
* NorWeST Stream Temp dataset provided by the Rocky Mountain Research Station. Available here: https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST.html#downloads
* Fish temperature thresholds: ???? @jennifer

Evaluation:

| Requirement | CRCC streamflow dataset | NorWeST Stream Temp | Fish temperature thresholds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Future projections of streamflow | Daily time series at 400 locations through end of 21st century| x | x |
| Future streamflow temperature projections | x | Projections of future streamflow for August at sites throughout PNW  | x |
