Requirements:
info required to answer question posed in the README

Sources:
* CRCC: Dataset available here http://hydro.washington.edu/CRCC/
* Future temperature fields at 1/16th degree: Available on cluster that Oriana/Andrew use. Will decide to either extract daily timeseries of temperature at streamflow point locations or use maps.
* Fish temperature thresholds: ???? @jennifer

Evaluation:

| Requirement | CRCC streamflow dataset | Future temperature fields | Fish temperature thresholds |
|---|---|---|---|
| Future projections of streamflow | Daily time series at 400 locations through end of 21st century| x |           
| Future temperature projections | x | Daily temperature information through end of 21st century  |
