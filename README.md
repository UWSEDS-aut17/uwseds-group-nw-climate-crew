# FutureFish Project

### Problem:
Climate change will have large affects on water resources all over the world. For this project we want to investigate how these changes will affect fish viability in the Pacific Northwest. This question is often complicated by the fact that the Columbia River is highly regulated with dams which can have detrimental impacts on fish habitat. We will envision a world without any human infrastructure impacts to pose the question: what impact is climate change _alone_ having on viable fish habitat in the Pacific Northwest?

We will use three datasets in this analysis:
(1) A new set of projections of streamflow within the Columbia River Basin
(2) A set of temperature projections for the same area.
(3) Measurements from USGS gauged rivers to develop a regression model between air temperature and stream temperature.
