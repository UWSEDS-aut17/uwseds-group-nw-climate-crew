### Problem:
Climate change will have large affects on water resources all over the world. For this project we want to investigate how these changes will affect agriculture in the Pacific Northwest. Further brainstorming needed.

Oriana has produced a dataset representing how Columbia River watershed will respond to climate change. We plan to use temperature and stream flow variables from her results.
