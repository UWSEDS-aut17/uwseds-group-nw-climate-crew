# Project Repository

This homework is done as a group. You will be creating your team repository.

You should do the following:
- Create a repository for your team with a license and a .gitignore file.
- Construct an initial README file that describes the problem you are addressing (but not necessarily how you will address it). Include at least one image and a link to another web page.
- Create a Docs folder, and in that folder create a file named data.md. The document should have the following sections:
  - Requirements. List the kind of information required to answer the questions described in the README file.
  - Sources. List the data sets that you are considering using, their content, and their availability.
  - Evaluation. The core part of this section is a table that analyzes the choice of data. The columns of the table are data sets described in the "Data" section. The rows are requirements of the data based on the questions you want to answer. You should complete the cells in the table.
  
Each person in the team should make at least one commit to the repository.
